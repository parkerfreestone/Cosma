# COSMA: Completely Original Social Media App

COSMA is a completely original, never conceived social media app where users can share what's really on their mind. Heavily inspired by current, yet inferior apps like twitter, and TRUTH Social. Mainly characterized by it's lovely UI and lack of features :(...

## A: Up and Running

### 🎅 1: Clone & Be Merry
Clone the repo into a directory of choice...

### 📬 2: Install dependencies &  Configure .env
Run `npm i && cd frontend && npm i && cd ../backend && npm i`

Clone the `.env.example` file and name it `.env` Then configure it to your liking!

### 👩🏿‍💻 3: Create DB
Cosma uses postgresql by default so get a DB up and running. Ensure the name of your db matches your .env

### 🚀 4: Run Cosma and Prosper
Use `npm run dev` to start the entire app up (courtesey of concurrently).
